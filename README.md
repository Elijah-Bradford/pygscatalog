This repository contains Python applications and libraries for working with polygenic scores (PGS :dna:) and the 
[PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/), an open database of polygenic scores and the relevant metadata required for 
accurate application and evaluation. It is based on a previous codebase of utilities ([pgscatalog_utils](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgscatalog_utils)) 
that has been converted to a namespace pacakge for modularity and re-use.

## User applications 

These CLI applications are used internally by the [PGS Catalog Calculator (`pgsc_calc`)](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc) 
workflow for calculating PGS and performing common adjustments for genetic ancestry. 

If you want an automatic method of calculating PGS, including genetic ancestry similarity estimation and PGS normalisation, 
the workflow is the easiest method.


| Application                  | Description                                                 | Link                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `pgscatalog-download`        | Download scoring files from the PGS Catalog                 | [README](pgscatalog.downloadapp/README.md) |
| `pgscatalog-combine`         | Combine multiple scoring files into a consistent structure  | [README](pgscatalog.combineapp/README.md) |
| `pgscatalog-match`           | Match structured scoring file to variants in target genomes | [README](pgscatalog.matchapp/README.md) |
| `pgscatalog-matchmerge`      | Merge variant match results, useful on larger datasets      | [README](pgscatalog.matchapp/README.md) |
| `pgscatalog-aggregate`       | Aggregate calculated PGS split across multiple files        | [README](pgscatalog.calcapp/README.md) |
| `pgscatalog-ancestry-adjust` | Adjust calculated PGS in the context of genetic ancestry    | [README](pgscatalog.calcapp/README.md) |

## Developer libraries

If you write Python code to work with PGS, the underlying libraries for the apps are documented and available for re-use:

| Library               | Description                                              | Link                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `pgscatalog-corelib`  | Core classes and functions to work with PGS data         | [README](pgscatalog.corelib/README.md) |
| `pgscatalog-matchlib` | Variant matching across scoring files and target genomes | [README](pgscatalog.matchlib/README.md)|
| `pgscatalog-calclib`  | Genetic ancestry similarity estimation and normalisation | [README](pgscatalog.calclib/README.md) |

## Credits & Licence

`pygscatalog`(_aka_ `pgscatalog_utils`) is developed as part of the [PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/) project, a
collaboration between the University of Cambridgeâ€™s Department of Public Health and Primary Care (Michael Inouye, 
Samuel Lambert) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (Helen Parkinson, Laura Harris).

This package contains code libraries and apps for working with PGS Catalog data and calculating PGS within the 
[PGS Catalog Calculator (`pgsc_calc`)](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc) workflow, and is based on an earlier 
codebase ([pgscatalog_utils](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgscatalog_utils)) with contributions and input from members 
of the PGS Catalog team (Samuel Lambert, Benjamin Wingfield, Aoife McMahon Laurent Gil) and Inouye lab 
(Rodrigo Canovas, Scott Ritchie, Jingqin Wu).

A manuscript describing this package and `pgsc_calc` pipeline is *in preparation*. In the meantime if you use the
